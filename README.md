Step 1- Selection of Words: Use random module to select a random word for player to guess and keep it secret from the player.

Step 2- Display: For each letter in the word, display a dash "_". This represents the hidden letters of the word.

Step 3- Guessing: The  player(s) guess letters one at a time. If the guessed letter is in the word, reveal all occurrences of that letter in the displayed word. If the guessed letter is not in the word, start drawing the hangman figure. Typically, there are 6 parts to the hangman figure (head, body, both arms, and both legs).

Step 4- Limit: Set a limit for the number of incorrect guesses allowed (typically 6, one for each part of the hangman). If the limit is reached before the word is guessed, the game ends and the secret word is revealed.

Step 5- Ending Conditions: The game ends in two cases either when the word is guessed correctly (all letters are revealed) or when the hangman figure is completed.

Step 6- Win/Lose: If the word is guessed correctly before the hangman is fully drawn, the guesser(s) win. If the hangman is fully drawn before the word is guessed, the guesser(s) lose.

Step 7- Play Again: After a game ends player should have a option to play again or end the game.
